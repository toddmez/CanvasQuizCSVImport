# CanvasQuizCSVImport

This is a script I created with the help of canvasapi wrapper to create MC quizzes in Instructure Canvas. 
Here is what you need: 
1. Canvas tolken. Place this in a text file called apikeyinfo.txt in the same directory as the ExamView py script.
2. Google Sheet. Found here: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KDlf25mfIDE4CgJ2XBRBzDH0OPCe6WMGEW2hIHhDW10/edit?usp=sharing". Make a copy of this and customize this and export your csv file. Place the csv in the same directory as above. Name it quizcontent.csv
3. The ExamView.py script. Run this to create your quiz!
